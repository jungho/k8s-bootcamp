# Storage #
## Volumes ##

For those applications that need to manage durable state, particularly, state that survives across container restarts, K8S provides the volume resource - there are multiple volume types such as NFS, [Azure Disk](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/volumes/azure_disk), [Azure File](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/blob/master/staging/volumes/azure_file/README.md), and more.

To the containers, volumes are just a directory on the file system.  The Docker image is at the root of the file system, and you can mount multiple volumes at specified paths within the image.  Each container in the pod must independently specify where to mount each volume.

Which volume type you use depends on your requirements:

- emptyDir volume type uses either memory or local filesystem for storage.  It only should be used for temp data
- hostPath volume maps the volume to a specific directory on the node.  This is useful if you have a daemonset that needs to access the same directory on all nodes.
- nsf volume type uses network storage using the nfs protocol.  Note there are many volume types that support network storage.  For example, azureFile, awsElasticBlockStore.  These are the volume types that you want to use so that when your pods are rescheduled to different nodes, the same volumes are still accessible.
- You need to access the volume from multiple nodes - use azureFile
- You need to access the volume from a single node - use azureDisk

* See the [Volume reference at K8S.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) for more details.
* See [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/blob/master/staging/volumes/azure_disk/azure.yaml) for an example of a pod that uses Azure Disk volumes.  Notice how you must first specify the volume, then mount the volume within your container specification.  How you specify the volume depends on the volume type.

## Persistent Volumes & Persistent Volume Claims ##

With Volumes the life-cycle of the storage is tied to the pod.  This means the volume survives container restarts, however, if the pod is destroyed, the volume storage will be blown away - not entirely true, this is the case for certain volume types e.g. emptyDir. This is not appropriate for applications such as databases that require the data is saved even if the pod is removed.  In addition, with volumes, Developers have to be aware of the underlying storage implementation.  For example, if you used an nsf volume type, the Developer would need to know about the nsf server, or if you used azureFile, you would have to know the url to the azure storage and storage account details.  Developers should not have to be aware of these infrastructure level details.  Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims and Storage Classes abstract away much of these details from the Developers.

Persistent Volumes (PV) are a volume type that is provisioned/defined by the cluster admin - they can be provisioned statically or dynamically.  They support different storage services via plugins.  For example, there is a PV type for AzureFile, AzureDisk, NFS and more.  They differ from volumes in that the cluster admin can pre-create volumes as resources that can be used by creators of the pods. This is beneficial as the pod creators do not have to be aware of the implementation details of the volumes - e.g. credentials, access keys, etc.

Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) are how pods "claim" the provisioned storage. In the claim is the request for amount of storage and access modes. A claim is fulfilled if there is a PV that meets the criteria specified in the claim.  Note this means that it is possible for a claim not to be fulfilled.  

**IMPORTANT: Once a PVC is bound to a PV, that relationship is one to one.** 

It is very important to understand that you can have a PV that is 10G and a PVC that only needs 3G can claim it, and not make the rest of the storage available.  This is obviously wasteful. 

Here is an excellent diagram from the [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action) book from Manning that describes this concept.

### Running the Example ###

To run the example you will need to do the following:

```sh
#we will run this example in minikube as it is faster.
minikube start 

kubectl create -f pv-hostpath.yml

kubectl get pv/pv-volume

#you should see something like this, note 5Gi is available
NAME        CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM     STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE
pv-volume   5Gi        RWO            Retain           Available                                      43s

#create a pvc 
kubectl create -f pvc-01.yml

kubectl get pvc/pv-claim-01

#Notice the pvc is bound, I asked for 1Gi but I got 5Gi because PVC to PV is one to one
NAME          STATUS    VOLUME      CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
pv-claim-01   Bound     pv-volume   5Gi        RWO                           8s

#try to create another pvc
kubectl create -f pvc-02.yml

kubectl get pvc/pv-claim-02

#Notice it is pending.  It will stay that way forever because the PV is already bound to pv-claim-01
NAME          STATUS    VOLUME      CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
pv-claim-02   Pending   pv-volume   0                                        5s

```

*Note: How a PV is reclaimed after a PVC is removed depends on the reclaim policy - Retain, Recycle, Delete. Delete is the most destructive as it also deletes the PV and the underlying backing storage.  Not all storage providers support all policies. See [reclaim policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#reclaiming) for details*

## Storage Classes ##

Creating Persistent Volumes statically requires the cluster admin to understand how many pods that require storage will be deployed and how much storage each will need.  However, what if you could dynamically provision persistent volumes when the pods are deployed?  That is the role of StorageClasses. 

Storage classes enable cluster admins to define different "classes" of persistent volumes.  These classes could vary by access modes, reclaim policy, storage provider (e.g. Azure, AWS, NFS, etc) and more.  The cluster admin can also specify a default storage class for those PVCs that do not specify a storage class.  

**Note: All cloud providers provide pre-defined storage classes.  You can define others as you see fit for your requirements**

PersistentVolumes also serves to abstract away the underlying storage implementation from the pod. This is beneficial when you have developers using a tool like minikube for development and production uses K8S on a cloud provider like Azure.  Instead of the pod definition being aware of the underlying storage implementation, it can use a PVC that specifies a storage class that uses the same name but different implementation across environments.

To find out what storage classes have been defined for you cluster run:

```bash
kubectl get storageclasses

#On Azure, this is what is returned

NAME                PROVISIONER
azurefile           kubernetes.io/azure-file
default (default)   kubernetes.io/azure-disk
managed-premium     kubernetes.io/azure-disk
managed-standard    kubernetes.io/azure-disk
```

Notice the default storage class is azure-disk.  This is the class that is used if a PVC does not specify a storage class.  To use a different storage class you would specify the desired storage class in your PVC's ``storageClassName`` attribute.

To get details of a specific storage class run:

```sh
kubectl describe storageclass/managed-premium
```

To get the details in yaml format run:

```sh
kubectl get storageclass/managed-premium -o=yaml
```

### Running the Example ###

```sh
kubectl create -f default-class-pvc.yml

kubectl get pvc

#you should see something similar.  Note several things:
# 1. I did not pre-create a Persistent Volume
# 2. A PV was dynamically created and the PVC was immediately bound.
# 3. The size of the PV is exactly what I requested in the PVC.
NAME                STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
pvc-default-class   Bound     pvc-7fe2dac2-265a-11e8-a59b-080027a22b9d   3Gi        RWO            default        4s

```

##  Understand The Constraints Of The Underlying Storage Implementation ##

It is very important to understand the constraints imposed by the underlying storage implementation.  For example, on Azure there are two provisioners - azureDisk and azureFile.  azureDisk comes in standard and premium, they are virtual hard disks (.vhd files) stored as page blogs in your Azure Storage account. These .vhds are mounted onto a specific VM, and Azure has fixed limits on how many data disks can be mounted onto a given VM size.  Furthermore, azureDisk only supports ReadWriteOnce access mode. Therefore, for stateful applications, you need to think hard about how many pod instances you need to determine how many data disks you need, and hence the appropriate VM size for the node.  

Azure also has the azureFile provisioner.  This provisioner essentially mounts a CIFS/Samba fileshare.  This has some limitations in that even though the cluster may be Linux, the underlying storage implementation will CIFS and hence does not support all Linux filesystem capabilities (e.g. symlinks)  It is also significantly slower than azureDisk.  On the other hand, AzureFile does support more access modes than Azure Disk.  This means, multiple pods can reference the SAME PVC that is bound to the same PV.

So you need to consider you use-cases and provisioner constraints to make the right decision.  In general:

* For fast performance and restrictive access modes e.g. databases use AzureDisk Premium
* For storage requirements for data that does not change often, e.d. static html, pre-rendered javascript, etc, that needs to be accessed by many pods then use AzureFile.

## Non-Root Containers and Volumes ##

When volumes are mounted onto a node, that volume is mounted with root ownership. This poses a challenge because the best practices with Docker images is to NOT run in privileged mode.  As much as possible, the process in the container should run as a specific UID/GID that is not root.  There are different way to deal with this depending on the volume implementation, however, the most standard way right now is use to initContainers.  An initContainer is a container that does some initialization work that must complete successfully prior to the primary container starting.  You can have the init container start up as root then `chown` and `chmod` to change owner and permissions to the UID:GID the primary container will run as.

See [non-root-pod-correct.yml](./non-root-pod-correct.yml) for an example.

Here is the issue that describes the problem - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/2630.  Note, this issue is scheduled to be addressed in the next major milestone.

Other approaches to address this issue without using initContainers are:

- Using [mountOptions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#mount-options), however, this is not supported by all volume types.  If using azureFile or azureDisk, this is the way to go.  You can set the mount options in the StorageClass.  See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-files-dynamic-pv#mount-options) for default mountOptions by K8S version.
- Using [pod.spec.securityContext.fsGroup](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/). This changes the owning GID of the volume to the GID set in fsGroup. Again, not supported by all volume types.  
- Using [pod.spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups). Enables you to specify additional linux supplementary groups for the process at runtime. Again, not supported by all volume types.

For supplementalGroups, the cluster admin needs to be aware of the permissions set in the target source.  For example, when an NFS share is mounted, the permissions and ownership of the target share is known, add the GID to the supplementalGroups.
