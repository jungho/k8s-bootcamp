# Packaging and deploying K8S applications using Helm #
## Pre-Requisites ##

You should have successfully set up your environment as outlined in [Day1/setup](../bootcamp/exercises/setup.md)
## Deploying the Todo Application ##

From within the helm directory run the following commands:

```sh
#1) ensure the helm client version and the tiller version on the server are compatible.
helm init --upgrade

#2) Create a namespace to deploy your app. Replace <namespace> with whatever namespace you choose. 
kubectl create namespace <namespace>

#3) Create secrets required by the app in the same namespace
./create_secrets.sh <namespace>

#4) do a dry run install to make sure everything is ok. This command will echo out the manifests that will be deployed. Review it carefully.
helm install --dry-run --debug architech/todo-app

#5) install the todo-app
helm install architech/todo-app --namespace <namespace>

#6) check that the app has been deployed.  You should see the todo-app has been deployed.
helm ls

```
You now need to get the external IP of the Loadbalancer service that has been provisioned.
Run `kubectl get services --namespace <namespace>` to get the external IP of the nginx-ingress service.  Your output will look similar to mine.

```sh
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
default-http-backend   ClusterIP      10.0.14.155    <none>         80/TCP         15m
mongodb                ClusterIP      10.0.31.188    <none>         27017/TCP      15m
nginx-ingress          LoadBalancer   10.0.155.10    52.235.38.16   80:30043/TCP   15m
todo-api               ClusterIP      10.0.85.46     <none>         8080/TCP       15m
todo-webui-service     ClusterIP      10.0.43.113    <none>         80/TCP         15m
user-api               ClusterIP      10.0.193.165   <none>         8082/TCP       15m

```

Then update the ingress resource to reflect the external IP.

```sh
#this will load the yaml manifest in your editor.
kubectl edit ingress/todo-app-ingress --namespace todo-app
```

Update the `host:` field with your `EXTERNAL-IP.nip.io` and save the file. kubectl will update the ingress with the new value.  Note, the host field only accepts a valid DNS name, IP addresses are not allowed.  To deal with this we will use a dynamnic DNS service called nip.io.

## Instructions for Minikube ##

You should have installed and started up minikube with RBAC enabled by falling the instructions in [setup](../bootcamp/exercises/setup.md).

Move the contents of [architech/todo-app/minikube](./architech/todo-app/minikube) directory to the architech/todo-app/templates directory.

Deploy the helm chart using the instructions above.

To get the IP of your nginx-ingress service, run:

```sh
minikube service list
```

Update the ingress resource as described above.

**With minikube, the external IP for the LoadBalancer service will always display as PENDING.  This is because minikube does not provision a LoadBalancer. Therefore, to access the application via your browser, you need to use the IP and port displayed.**
