# Troubleshooting #

There absolutely will be times when you deploy an application where things do not go as expected.  Below are some troubleshooting tactics.

```sh

#get the logs for a given pod.  Add --namespace <namespace-name> as appropriate
#First get the pod-name
kubectl get pods --namespace <namespace-name>

#then get the logs for the pod you are interested in
kubectl logs <pod-name>

#If the pod has multiple containers and you want the log for a specific container
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>

#Use kubectl describe
kubectl describe <pod-name>

#look at the event stream in another terminal window as you deploy the application
#Each of the controllers will raise events as they take their action
kubectl get events

#access the running pod and verify the process is running
#This assumes that the container has the bash shell, replace with another command as appropriate
kubectl exec -ti <pod-name> -- bash

```

## Exercise Objective ##

Deploy the todo-app helm chart in [todo-app](./todo-app).  There is a small issue with this chart.  It will deploy but the application will fail to run.  Try to find out what the issue is and correct it.

```sh
#On AKS, the necessary rolebinding for helm to be able to deploy resources to the necessary namespaces. This is required if you have NOT already done so.
#to give the default service account in each namespace permissions to access the necessary resources. 
#This is not required on Minikube.
kubectl create -f default-rolebinding.yaml

#first create a namespace to work in
kubectl create namespace troubleshooting

#then create the necessary secrets and namespace for the deployment
./create_secrets troubleshooting

#deploy the helm chart
helm --namespace troubleshooting install todo-app

```
